# verbatim-copy-v1

Tasks that ask the model to reproduce a block of auto-generated text exactly, returning the copy inside `<answer>` tags. Scored by exact match against the original text (Levenshtein similarity is also logged as a metric).

## Taskset

- **Source:** Procedurally generated with Faker (synthetic words, JSON, CSV, UUID/alphanumeric codes, or a mix, with optional fragmentation).
- **Size:** 100 synthetic tasks by default (`num_samples`, configurable); each task presents one auto-generated text passage to reproduce verbatim.

## Changelog

- 2026-06-24: Initial v1 taskset.
